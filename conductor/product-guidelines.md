# Product Guidelines: MotionBlocks

## Visual Identity
- **Aesthetic:** Minimalist & Professional. The interface should be clean, high-contrast, and content-focused. Leverage the default clean aesthetic of Shadcn components to ensure a professional "pro-tool" look and feel.
- **Layout:** Prioritize clarity and information density. Controls should be organized logically around the central canvas, minimizing clutter while keeping essential tools within reach.

## Motion & Interaction Design
- **Animation Style:** Impactful & Spatial.
    - **Impact:** Use quick transitions and "snappy" animations to provide clear feedback and catch the eye.
    - **Depth:** Integrate 3D libraries to create a sense of layers, perspective, and spatial awareness within the 2D composition space.
- **Feedback:** Every user action should have a clear, immediate visual confirmation, utilizing motion to emphasize state changes.

## Tone & Voice
- **Prose Style:** Helpful & Explanatory. Documentation and in-app labels should guide the user clearly, using descriptive language (e.g., "Save your video", "Frames per second") to make the powerful features accessible.
- **Communication:** Be direct but supportive, ensuring the user understands "why" something is happening, especially during technical processes like rendering.

## User Experience Values
- **Accessibility:** Ensure the tool is usable by everyone by strictly adhering to accessibility standards provided by Shadcn components and maintaining high contrast ratios.
- **Empowerment:** Design workflows that make complex motion graphics tasks feel simple. The user should feel empowered to achieve high-fidelity results with minimal effort and learning curve.
- **Consistency:** Maintain a consistent UI patterns across all panels (Assets, Templates, Inspector) to reduce cognitive load and build user confidence.
